#Chef and Chefina are playing with dice. In one turn, both of them roll their dice at once.
#They consider a turn to be good if the sum of the numbers on their dice is greater than 6.
#Given that in a particular turn Chef and Chefina got XX and YY on their respective dice, find whether the turn was good.
#code:

i=int(input( ))
for a in range (i) :
     x,y=map(int,input().split())
     sum=x+y
     if sum > 6:
         print("yes")
     else:
         print("no")
